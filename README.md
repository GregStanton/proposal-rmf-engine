# proposal-rmf-engine
A state-of-the-art high-fidelity engine for a composable system of sweep geometries and rail-based motions, with an intuitive API suitable for creative-coding libraries. Designed to efficiently minimize distortions, based on the double-reflection method for rotation minimizing frames.
